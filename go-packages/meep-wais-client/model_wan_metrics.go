	DownlinkSpeed int32 `json:"downlinkSpeed"`
	// The LMD (Load Measurement Duration) field is a 2-octet positive integer representing the duration over which the Downlink Load and Uplink Load have been measured, in tenths of a second. When the actual load measurement duration is greater than the maximum value, the maximum value will be reported. The value of the LMD field is set to 0 when neither the uplink nor downlink load can be computed. When the uplink and downlink loads are computed over different intervals, the maximum interval is reported.

In cases where the uplink load is unknown to the AP, the value is set to zero.
	UplinkLoad int32 `json:"uplinkLoad"`
	// 4-octet positive integer whose value is an estimate of the WAN Backhaul link's current uplink speed in kilobits per second.
